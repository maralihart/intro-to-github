## What Is Git?
Imagine Google Docs, but way better and for coding. When you work in Google Docs, you can see what was edited, by who, and when!

When using Git, it's the same thing. You're able to take snapshots throughout the coding process to "save" your code. This is great when you mess up and need to go back to your last saved checkpoint or you need to know who wrote a certain piece of code.

A system where you can see what changes were made, when they were made, who made them, and why they were made is called **Version Control System**.

We use Git because it's so widely utilized and allows developers to work *independently on the same time*.

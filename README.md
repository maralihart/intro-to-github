# Introduction to GitHub
Curriculum written for [Mara Hart's Twitch (MaraDrinksMilk)](https://twitch.tv/maradrinksmilk), inspired by [GitHubGuides](guides.github.com)

This curriculum was written specifically for use cases with hackathons!

## Tools We'll Be Using
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
* [Git Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.git-extension-pack) - an extension for Visual Studio Code

## What Is Git?
Imagine Google Docs, but way better and for coding. When you work in Google Docs, you can see what was edited, by who, and when!

When using Git, it's the same thing. You're able to take snapshots throughout the coding process to "save" your code. This is great when you mess up and need to go back to your last saved checkpoint or you need to know who wrote a certain piece of code.

A system where you can see what changes were made, when they were made, who made them, and why they were made is called **Version Control System**.

We use Git because it's so widely utilized and allows developers to work *independently on the same time*.

## The GitHub Flow
Let's pretend we're coding for a hackathon. The first thing we want to do to get started is to **create a repository**.

A repository is essentially a project folder. 

**Steps to Set Up a Repository**:
1. Create a GitHub account!
2. Click the `+` in the top right
3. Select "New repository" to open a new page to set up your repository
4. Name your repository whatever you'd like - it just has to be unique to your account! Typically a descriptive name is best.
5. Next initialize this repository by clicking `Add a README file`. This will allow you to have a file that you can update with documentation. That's what we'll be editing through
